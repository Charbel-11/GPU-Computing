# GPU Computing

This is a collection of algorithms written in CUDA and to be run on GPU-enabled computers. It aims at improving the runtime of typical sequential implementations of those algorithms.

## Problems
The following problems were tackled:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Convolution computation
* Histogram finding
* Merge algorithm
* Reduction algorithm
* Scan algorithms (inclusive and exclusive)
* Sort algorithms 
  * Radix sort 
  * Merge sort
* Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication representing sparse matrices with COO, CSR and ELL formats
* Vector Operations

## Results
