# GPU Computing

This is a collection of algorithms written in CUDA and to be run on GPU-enabled computers. The aim is to improve the runtime of their typical sequential implementations.

## Problems
The following problems were tackled:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Convolution computation
* Histogram finding
* Merge algorithm
* Reduction algorithm
* Scan algorithms (inclusive and exclusive)
* Sort algorithms 
  * Radix sort 
  * Merge sort
* Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication where sparse matrices are represented using either COO, CSR or ELL formats
* Vector Operations

## Results
